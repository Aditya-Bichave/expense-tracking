## 2024-10-24 - Context-Aware Tooltips
**Learning:** Generic tooltips like "Add" are insufficient for multi-context buttons (FABs). Screen reader users miss context (Add what?) and sighted users lose clarity.
**Action:** Always map FAB actions to their specific context (e.g., "Add Transaction", "Add Account") using the current navigation index.
